\# No Zomies



A simple mod that removes the Zombie spawners (and hence zombies) on all difficulties instead of just tenderfoot.



Use this both client and server side to be safe, untested individually.



I made this because I saw someone say about a mod like this on twitter and thought sure why not, I don't plan on actually using it myself lol.
